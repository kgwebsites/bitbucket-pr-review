This is a forked version of [bitbucket-pr-review](https://github.com/reywood/bitbucket-pr-review) with additional features such as:

-   Close all snapshot files
-   Close all test files
-   Bitbucket file titles become sticky so the file action buttons come along for the ride when you're scrolling large files.

```
During the back and forth of reviewing a large pull request, it's easy to lose track of what you've already reviewed and what you haven't. This extension adds a new button to the header of each file in a pull request that allows you to toggle the reviewed/unreviewed status of that file. If the file is later updated or commented on after you've marked it as reviewed, it will revert to the unreviewed state. This makes it much easier to focus on only the files that need your attention.
```
